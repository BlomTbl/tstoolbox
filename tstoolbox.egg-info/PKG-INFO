Description: TSTOOLBOX
        =========
        The tstoolbox is a Python script to manipulate time-series.  Based on
        scikits.timeseries.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Python requirements for all platforms
        -------------------------------------
        * scikits.timeseries - on Windows this is part of the Python(x,y) distribution
          (http://www.pythonxy.com/) 
        
        * baker - command line parser
        
        Installation
        ============
        Should be as easy as running ``easy_install tstoolbox`` at any command line.
        Not sure on Windows whether this will bring in scikits.timeseries, but as
        mentioned above, if you start with Python(x,y) then you won't have a problem.
        
        The tstoolbox script is actually made up of two parts, 'tstoolbox.py' which
        handles all command line interaction and 'tsutil.py' which is a library of
        functions that 'tstoolbox.py' uses.  This means that you can write your own
        scripts to access ts files by importing the functionality from 'tsutil.py'.
        
        Running
        =======
        Just run 'tstoolbox.py' to get a list of subcommands::
        
            Usage: /sjr/beodata/local/bin/tstoolbox.py COMMAND <options>
            
            Available commands:
            
             aggregate               Takes a time series and aggregates to specified
                                     frequency, outputs to 'ISO-8601date,value' format.
             centered_moving_window  Calculates a centered moving window statistic.
             converttoexcelcsv       Prints out data to the screen in a CSV format
                                     compatible with Excel.
             converttozrxp           Prints out data to the screen in a WISKI ZRXP
                                     format.
             moving_window           Calculates a moving window statistic.
             plot                    Time series plot.
            
            Use "/sjr/beodata/local/bin/tstoolbox.py <command> --help" for individual command help.
        
        If a subcommand accepts an input file for an arguement, you can use '-' to
        indicate that the input is from a pipe.  For the subcommands that output data
        it is printed to the screen and you can then redirect to a file.

          The scikits.timeseries was trowing a segmentation fault.  Unproven, but
          suspect it was because of the latest numpy.  Only developed a work-around -
          eventually will move to the new datetime64 in numpy 1.7 and greater.
