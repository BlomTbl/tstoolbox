0.1

*Release date: 2011-04-22*

* Initial release

0.2
---

*Release date: 2011-10-21*

  The scikits.timeseries was throwing a segmentation fault.  Unproven, but
  suspect it was because of the latest numpy.  Only developed a work-around -
  eventually will move to the new datetime64 in numpy 1.7 and greater.

0.2.1
---

*Release date: 2011-10-25*

  Fixed how the start_date and end_date keywords were handled.  Minor bug
  fixes and code cleanups.

0.3

*Release date: 2012-12-05

  Removed everything from scikits.timeseries to pandas.

  Took as much advantage of pandas as I could to streamline many of the
  sub-commands.

  Added 'date_slice' sub-command and started to remove the '--start_date' and
  '--end_date' options from other commands.  Use 'date_slice' instead in the
  pipe.

0.3.1

*Release date: 2012-12-05

  Removed print statement used for debugging.

0.4

*Release date: 2012-12-17

  Added 'equation' subcommand to manipulate time-series.
  Added 'read' subcommand to read in multiple files at once.
  Finished 'peak_detection' subcommand.
  Added '--print_input' option to those subcommands where it made sense.
